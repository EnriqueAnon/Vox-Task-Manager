Task Manager Web App (Phase 2 Deliverable)
File: index.html

Contents:
- Mobile-first single-file web app (HTML/CSS/JS) implementing add/delete/update (complete) and persistence via localStorage.
- Accessibility: semantic elements, aria-labels, focus states.
- Responsive: flexible units, avoids horizontal scrolling.
- Testing plan & deployment instructions below (read this comment for next steps).

How to use:
1. Open this file in a browser (double-click index.html).
2. Add tasks using the input and "Add" button. Tasks are stored in localStorage and survive page reloads.
3. Use filters (All, Active, Completed). Tap the task checkbox to mark complete. Use the edit/delete icons to modify.

Deployment (quick):
- GitHub Pages: create a repo, push this file as index.html to the repo root or the gh-pages branch. Then enable Pages in repository settings.
- Netlify / Vercel: connect repo; they auto-deploy. Or drag-and-drop the folder containing index.html into Netlify's "Deploy site".

Capacitor (to generate APK):
1. Build the web-ready bundle (for single file, just copy index.html and assets to a folder called "www").
2. npm init -y
3. npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli --save-dev
4. npx cap init task-manager com.example.taskmanager
5. copy the web bundle into the Capacitor project: put index.html into <project_root>/www
6. npx cap add android
7. npx cap sync
8. npx cap open android  # opens Android Studio; then build a signed APK via Android Studio

Minimal Testing Plan (use when submitting):
- Functional: Add Task, Complete Task (toggle), Delete Task, Persistence after reload.
- Usability: test on two mobile breakpoints (e.g., 360x800 and 412x915). Ensure touch targets >= 48x48px.
- Performance: verify quick UI updates (<200ms on toggles on modern devices).
